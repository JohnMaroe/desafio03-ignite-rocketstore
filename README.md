# Ignite - #3 challenge

### Rocketseat's bootcamp third challenge. <br />
E-commerce shopping cart application, consuming a fake database to create the layout, the user can choose between different products and manage their cart. üå¥<br /><br />
When accessing their cart, the user will have full control over the quantity, deletion and total cleaning of it. Visual cues help guider the user with adding and removing. <br />
The total and subtotal is always readily avaiable to be reviewed. <br />

The focus of this challenge was learning how to properly structure a React Context and good practices with it.
A great amount of code revolves around dealing with the API and formating the information in specifics context.
This one was really fun and challenging. ‚òÑÔ∏è
